I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory (SEAL) at UCLA, working with
<a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/">Prof. Miryung Kim</a>. 

My research interests lie in program analysis and software testing, with a focus on making program analysis scalable to address the challenges associated with the scale and complexity of software systems. I aim to achieve practical software testing in real-world scenarios by utilizing statistical methods to analyze dynamic information from program execution, facilitating the reasoning of a program's semantic properties and addressing empirical challenges in software testing.

Prior to joining SEAL, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the
<a href="https://www.mpi-sp.org">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)</a>
in Bochum, Germany, where I worked with
<a href="https://mboehme.github.io">Dr. Marcel BÃ¶hme</a> in the
<a href="https://mpi-softsec.github.io">Software Security group</a>. I received my Ph.D. in
<a href="https://coinse.github.io">Computation Intelligence and Software Engineering Lab (COINSE)</a>
at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/">KAIST</a>, advised by
<a href="https://coinse.github.io/members/shin.yoo/">Dr. Shin Yoo</a> in 2022.
